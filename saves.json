J is the title that scholars ascribe to the nameless writer they believe is responsible for the text, written between 950 and 900 BCE, on which Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers is based. In The Book of J, accompanying David Rosenberg's translation, Harold Bloom persuasively argues that J was a woman?very likely a woman of the royal house at King Solomon's court?and a writer of the stature of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy. Rosenberg's translations from the Hebrew bring J's stories to life and reveal her towering originality and grasp of humanity. Bloom argues in several essays that \"J\" was not a religious writer but a fierce ironist. He also offers historical context, a discussion of the theory of how the different texts came together to create the Bible, and translation notes.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0802141919"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780802141910"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":340,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Religion"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":5,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.0.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xDJKaYWzrvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xDJKaYWzrvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=xDJKaYWzrvwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=j&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=xDJKaYWzrvwC&dq=j&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Book_of_J.html?hl=&id=xDJKaYWzrvwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books/download/Book_of_J-sample-epub.acsm?id=xDJKaYWzrvwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xDJKaYWzrvwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In The Book of J, accompanying David Rosenberg&#39;s translation, Harold Bloom persuasively argues that J was a woman?very likely a woman of the royal house at King Solomon&#39;s court?and a writer of the stature of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"eH8bcRgT6CcC","etag":"2dTrhr7/mWE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/eH8bcRgT6CcC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Making the Grade with A+DD","subtitle":"A Student's Guide to Succeeding in College with Attention Deficit Disorder","authors":["Stephanie Sarkis"],"publisher":"New Harbinger  Publications","publishedDate":"2008-01-01","description":"Provides advice for students with ADD on succeeding in college, discussing how to keep physically healthy, manage a class schedule, handle medication, maintain a social life, use study techniques, and ask for accommodations if necessary.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781572245549"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1572245549"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":238,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Education"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.0.3.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eH8bcRgT6CcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eH8bcRgT6CcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=eH8bcRgT6CcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=dd&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=eH8bcRgT6CcC&dq=dd&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_the_Grade_with_A+DD.html?hl=&id=eH8bcRgT6CcC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eH8bcRgT6CcC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Provides advice for students with ADD on succeeding in college, discussing how to keep physically healthy, manage a class schedule, handle medication, maintain a social life, use study techniques, and ask for accommodations if necessary."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"gxxJAAAAMAAJ","etag":"XvvehWUEw98","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/gxxJAAAAMAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Annual Report - South Dakota Department of Agriculture","authors":["South Dakota.
